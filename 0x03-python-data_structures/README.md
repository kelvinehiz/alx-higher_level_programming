In this project, we look at how sequence data types work in Python - specifically, lists and tuples.

0-print_list_integer.py: Python function that prints all integers of a list, one per line.

1-element_at.py: Python function that retrieves an element from a list.

2-replace_in_list.py: Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

3-print_reversed_list_integer.py: Python function that prints all integers of a list, one per line, in reverse order.

4-new_in_list.py: Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

5-no_c.py: Python function that removes all characters c and C from a string and returns the string.

6-print_matrix_integer.py: Python function that prints a matrix of integers, one row per line.

7-add_tuple.py: Python function that adds two tuples.

8-multiple_returns.py: Python function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9-max_integer.py: Python function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

10-divisible_by_2.py: Python function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. 
Returns a new list of the same size. Each element of the new list contains either True or False corresponding to whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2.

11-delete_at.py: Python function that deletes an item at a specific position in a list.

12-switch.py: Python program that switches the values of variable a and b.

13-is_palindrome.c: C function that checks if a singly-linked list is a palindrome.

100-print_python_list_info.c: C function that prints basic information about Python lists.
