In this project, we look at python - if/else, loops and break, continue, pass, range statements with while and for loops.

0-positive_or_negative.py: Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and prints whether number is positive or negative.

1-last_digit.py: Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and prints its last digit

2-print_alphabet.py: Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

3-print_alphabt.py: Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

4-print_hexa.py: Python program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.

5-print_comb2.py: Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 two digits each.

6-print_comb3.py: Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order.

7-islower.py: Python function that checks for lowercase characters.

8-uppercase.py: Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

9-print_last_digit.py: Python function that prints the last digit of a number.

10-add.py: Python function that returns the addition of two integers.

11-pow.py: Python function that returns a to the power of b.

12-fizzbuzz.py: Python function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 followed by a space.
For multiples of three, Fizz is printed instead of the number.
For multiples of five, Buzz is printed instead of the number.
For multiples of three and five, FizzBuzz is printed instead of the number.

13-insert_number.c: C function that inserts a number into a sorted linked list.
If the function fails, returns NULL.

100-print_tebahpla.py: Python program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line.

101-remove_char_at.py: Python function that creates a copy of a string without the character at position n.

102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by ALX.
